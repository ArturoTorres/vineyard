\usage{
lm.yield.applied.riesling(
  stat.rain0.ries,
  stat.tmin1.ries,
  stat.tmin01.ries,
  stat.rain1.ries,
  stat.tmin02.ries,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{stat.rain0.ries}{numeric, vector with two columns: 1) year, and 2) first statistic for precipitation.}

\item{stat.tmin1.ries}{numeric, vector with two columns: 1) year, and 2) first statistic for min temperature.}

\item{stat.tmin01.ries}{numeric, vector with two columns: 1) year, and 2) second statistic for min temperature.}

\item{stat.rain1.ries}{numeric, vector with two columns: 1) year, and 2) second statistic for precipitation.}

\item{stat.tmin02.ries}{numeric, vector with two columns: 1) year, and 2) third statistic for min temperature.}

\item{model}{the predefined model e.g. linear regression (lm). Should be a match between the linear
regression coefficients and each statistic in the same definition order.}
}
\value{
data.frame, n obs. of 4 variables (year, predicted yield for Riesling), and lower and upper values
represent the uncertainty band with 95 percent confidence level. n is the total number of years for prediction.
