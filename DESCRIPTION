Description: Late frosts are a significant risk to grape production in 
    frost-prone viticultural regions. Increasing air temperature because 
    of climate change is likely to advance grape bud break and last frost 
    events in spring. So far, it is unclear whether one trend will be more 
    pronounced than the other, and hence, whether the risk of late frost 
    damage will increase or decrease. The aim of this package is to provide 
    tools for investigating e.g. the future frost risk in winegrowing regions 
    by assessing the effect of simulated future climate conditions on the 
    timing of bud break and last frost date. Late frost risk can be assessed 
    by the implementation of phenological models for bud break of the grapevine.
