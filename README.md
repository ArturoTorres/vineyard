VINEYARD is a software package developed by LIST.

Late frosts are a significant risk to grape production in
frost-prone viticultural regions. Increasing air temperature because
of climate change is likely to advance grape budburst and last frost
events in spring. So far, it is unclear whether one trend will be more
pronounced than the other, and hence, whether the risk of late frost
damage will increase or decrease. The aim of this package is to provide
tools for investigating e.g. the future frost risk in winegrowing regions
by assessing the effect of simulated future climate conditions on the
timing of budburst and last frost date. Late frost risk can be assessed
by the implementation of phenological models for budburst of the grapevine.
